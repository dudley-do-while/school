# WGU Bachelor of Science, Computer Science

Hello fellow student, 

Welcome to my tools and tutorials for surviving WGU!  So far, that means using containers to build development environments with the express purpose of avoiding the silly web-based Windows VMs provided by WGU.

c170 has some info on how to create an easy-to-replace container environment for mysql.

d191 has instructions and the files necessary to build a container based environment for developing the final project.
